##  🫁 Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning 

Lung cancer is one of the most **life-threatening diseases**, where **early detection** plays a critical role in improving patient survival rates.  
This project presents a **Machine Learning–based medical prediction system** designed to identify the likelihood of lung cancer using patient symptoms and lifestyle factors.

The model analyzes multiple health indicators such as:
- Smoking and alcohol consumption
- Chest pain, wheezing, coughing
- Swallowing difficulty, fatigue, anxiety
- Chronic disease and allergy indicators

and predicts a **binary outcome**:
- `1 → Lung Cancer Detected`
- `0 → No Lung Cancer`

### 🎯 Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build a **reliable and medically safe prediction system** by prioritizing **Recall score**, followed by Precision and overall Accuracy.

> ⚠️ In medical diagnosis, a **False Negative** (cancer present but not detected) can be fatal.  
> Therefore, this project focuses on **maximizing Recall** to ensure that cancer cases are not missed.

### 🔬 Approach Summary
- End-to-end ML pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation
- Comparison of **14 Machine Learning & Deep Learning algorithms**
- Special focus on **Boosting and Ensemble techniques**
- Final model selection based on **balanced medical performance**, not just accuracy

This project demonstrates a **real-world healthcare application of Machine Learning**, combining technical rigor with domain-specific decision making.
